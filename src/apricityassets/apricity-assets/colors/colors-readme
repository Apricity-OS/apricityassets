Colors: A Plymouth startup and shutdown animated splash (version 1)
For additional commentary and insights, go to www3.telus.net/someubuntufreebies/

Here I confine myself to actions that are executed in a terminal. If your file manager presents
a 'Run in Terminal' option when double-clicking an executable text file, then you can use that approach.

1. Download and extract the Colors Plymouth theme. This will create an 'colors-splash' subfolder.
2. In a terminal, navigate into the colors-splash folder and execute:
      ./install-colors [ENTER]
3. At the prompt, enter the number for the colors theme.

The plymouth-x11 package will be installed to provide for testing the theme without re-booting. After that,
a 10-second test preview of your new startup and shutdown theme will be displayed.

If you attempt any modifications, and those modifications inadvertently result in a black startup screen, 
the fastest way to recover is to re-extract the download, and then re-install it.

If you have not made any changes to the files in the colors-splash folder, you can repeat the test with:
  ./test-plymouth [ENTER]
 
In the case where the duration of the startup animation is very, very short, improvement MIGHT be obtained
by executing in the colors-splash folder:
  ./assert-framebuffer

If you are ultimately displeased with the theme or it just will not perform well on your hardware, you can
restore the original Plymouth splash as follows.
Navigate in a terminal to the colors-splash folder and execute:
  ./update-plymouth [ENTER]
When requested, enter the number of the ubuntu-logo theme or any other theme that you were using previously.
